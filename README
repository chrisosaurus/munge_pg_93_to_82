A dirty c program to quickly munge a postgres 9.3 plain sql dump so that it can be loaded into postgres 8.2

For more information see [http://segfault.net.nz/posts/2014-10-19-postgres-replication-93-to-82.html]

Compile:

    make

Run:
    ./munge_pg_93_to_82 path_to_pg_93_plain_sql_dump.sql

and then continue loading your pg dump as per usual

    psql -h foo -U bar -d baz -f path_to_pg_93_plain_sql_dump.sql

A dirty c program to quickly munge a postgres 9.3 plain sql dump so that it can be loaded into postgres 8.2

For more information see [http://segfault.net.nz/posts/2014-10-19-postgres-replication-93-to-82.html]

Compile:

    make

Run:
    ./munge_pg_93_to_82 path_to_pg_93_plain_sql_dump.sql

and then continue loading your pg dump as per usual

    psql -h foo -U bar -d baz -f path_to_pg_93_plain_sql_dump.sql


---

Known issues:

* It is possible for munge_pg_93_to_82 to successfully modify the first line, and then fail to modify the second, leaving the edited file half-done. It is trivial to changing the order of the read/writes to reduce the changes of this occuring.
